<P>
There is a similar syntax for experimental multipage compression:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>minidjvu  [</B><I>options</I><B>] </B><I>input_files</I><B> </B><I>output_template</I>

<P>
See
<B>MULTIPAGE ENCODING </B>

section below for more details.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

minidjvu encodes and decodes single-page black-and-white DjVu files.
<P>
minidjvu is derived from DjVuLibre, which is the primary support library
for DjVu.
<P>
Besides bitonal DjVu, minidjvu understands Windows BMP, PBM and TIFF (through
libtiff) formats.
Both
<I>inputfile</I>

and
<I>outputfile</I>

may be BMP, PBM, TIFF or DjVu. The file type is determined by extension.
Input and output may coincide.
<P>
When given a DjVu-to-DjVu job, minidjvu decodes, then re-encodes the image.
DjVu layers other than bitonal picture are lost.
<P>
Specifying a bitmap-to-bitmap job is possible, but relatively useful only with
<B>--smooth</B>

option.
<P>
Note: 0.5 is an early release, the command-line interface may still change.
That mostly applies to DjVu-to-DjVu and bitmap-to-bitmap behaviors.
<P>
All options preceded by two hyphens can be used with one hyphen.
This is done to make minidjvu interface more familiar for DjVuLibre users.

<H2>MULTIPAGE ENCODING</H2>

<P>
In the 0.4 version, there's a preliminary multipage encoder which cannot bundle
pages yet. When I have the time, I'll change this to producing a normal
bundled DjVu.
<P>
To use the encoder, specify more than one input file and a `template' instead
of the output file name. A template is a file name that ends with some zeroes
and extension. Here's the example:
<P>
<B>minidjvu a.tiff b.bmp c.djvu out0.djvu</B>

<P>
This will produce out1.djvu, out2.djvu and out3.djvu, and also out1.iff
(a dictionary). Multipage encoding implies -m (running pattern matcher).
<P>
You can view the resulting pages, but they will appear detached.
<P>
To bundle the pages, you'll need
<B>djvm</B>

from DjVuLibre. Use something like
<P>
<B>djvm -c result.djvu out*.djvu</B>

<P>
and you'll get all the pages in one file.
Do NOT give dictionaries to djvm, they'll be picked up automatically.
<P>
Note two new options:
<B>--pages-per-dict</B>

and
<B>--report.</B>

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-a </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
<DT><B>--aggression </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Sets aggression for pattern matching. The more the aggression, the less the
file size, but the more likely substitution errors will occur. The default is
100. Usually you can raise it to about 110 more or less safely. Probably even
200 will work fine, but don't rely on that.
<P>
Consistent aggression levels between versions is not guaranteed.
The default, however, will always be 100.
<P>
This option turns on
<B>--match</B>

automatically.
<P>
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>--clean</B>

<DD>
Remove small black marks that are probably noise.
This algorithm can really devastate halftone patterns, so use with caution.
<P>
This option is turned on by
<B>--lossy.</B>

<P>
<DT><B>-d </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
<DT><B>--dpi </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Specify the resolution of an image, measured in dots per inch.
The resolution affects some algorithms and it's recorded in DjVu
and BMP files (TIFF should join someday).
<P>
<DT><B>-e</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>--erosion</B>

<DD>
Sacrifice image quality to gain about 5-10% in file size.
One erosion is almost invisible, but 10 erosions in a row spoil an image badly
(and they won't give you 50-100% of file size, alas).
Erosion bonus stacks with pattern matching.
<P>
Erosion makes no sense when the output is not DjVu.
<P>
This option is turned on by
<B>--lossy.</B>

<P>
<DT><B>-l</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>--lossy</B>

<DD>
Turn on all lossy options. Is equivalent to
<B>--smooth</B>

<B>--clean</B>

<B>--erosion</B>

<B>--match.</B>

<P>
<P>
<DT><B>-m</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>--match</B>

<DD>
Run pattern matching. This is the main method of shrinking the file size,
but it can also bring trouble with substitution errors. Use
<B>--aggression</B>

option to maintain balance between file size and error probability.
<P>
This option is turned on by
<B>--lossy</B>

or 
<B>--aggression.</B>

<P>
<DT><B>-n</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>--no-prototypes</B>

<DD>
Disable prototype searching. This makes lossless compression faster,
but produced files become much bigger.
<P>
<DT><B>-p</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>--pages-per-dict</B>

<DD>
Specify how many pages to compress in one pass. The default is all.
If it consumes too much memory, try
<B>-p 10</B>

or
<B>-p 2.</B>

<P>
<P>
<DT><B>-r</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>--report</B>

<DD>
Print verbose messages about what's done on which page.
Works only with multipage encoding.
Useful only to survive boredom while compressing a book.
<P>
<P>
<DT><B>-s</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>--smooth</B>

<DD>
Flip some pixels that appear to be noise. The gain in file size is about 5%.
Visually the image is slightly improved, but it's hardly noticeable.
<P>
Current filter is dumb and only removes black pixels with
at least 3 white neighbors (of 4). You probably won't notice the effects.
<P>
This option is turned on by
<B>--lossy.</B>

<P>
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>--verbose</B>

<DD>
Print messages about various stages of the process.
It's not very useful, but interesting to examine.
<P>
<DT><B>-w</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>--warnings</B>

<DD>
Do not disable libtiff warnings. By default, TIFF warnings are supressed.
Under Windows default TIFF warning handler creates a message box.
This is unacceptable in a batch processing script, for instance.
So the minidjvu default behavior is a workaround for libtiff default behavior.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

Without
<B>--dpi</B>

specified, resolution of re-encoded DjVu images is reset to 300 dpi.
<P>
Multipage encoder does not work properly if pages have different resolution.
